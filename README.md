# Mask And Shader

> Practice Git, shaders, and the basics of Unity by participating in this project.

I was preparing a workshop for the in coming year 2026 when I read the theme "Mask".

An idea come to my mind, create a Hello World where the student learn what is 3D by creating a mask.
Then create a Shader Effect linked to it to apply at the Quest3 Camera  or VR Filter (for no AR headset).

The application make appear masks of the community randomly in the field of view to play with.
The player can grap it and see through them. 

What to learn:
- Create a Mask
  - Create a 3D object
  - Create a mask and texture
  - create git package with dependency
  - Make an asset that is loadable at runtime
  - Learn to respect convention
    - Resources
    - Name
    - Credit script
    - Texture ready to use script.
- Use Git to save a package
- Use Git Fork to add your package to the project.
